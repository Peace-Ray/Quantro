    <!-- By default, hardware Accel is disabled.  A bug existed
    		in pre-4.1 that (on some devices) prevented disabling
    		HW Accel on the view-level, meaning HW accel would be on
    		when a BlockDrawer call was made which used clipRegion
    		(a forbidden operation).  For that reason, we globally
    		disable HW accel unless we can be sure that view-level
    		disables will work (i.e., in everything before 4.1).
    		
    		This variable will be loaded when version is >= 4.1,
    		meaning HW accel is enabled by default.  We use view-level
    		controls to disable it in problem areas. -->
