<p><subsubheader>Quantro Special Pieces</subsubheader></p>

<p><term><a href="game_modes.html#quantro">Quantro</a></term> games use four basic types
of <term>special pieces</term>.  These pieces appear randomly
in <term><a href="controls.html#reserve">reserve</a></term> and can be used at
any time to replace the currently falling
piece.</p>

<p>The normal <term>tetrominoes</term> and <term>tetracubes</term> in Quantro will stack and clear
separately in the <fg>foreground</fg> and <bg>background</bg>.  Special pieces, by contrast, will often
interact with both the <fg>foreground</fg> and <bg>background</bg> in unique ways.  Because of this,
special pieces can be dangerous if you aren't careful, but when used skillfully can
dramatically improve your chances in a game.</p>

<table class="subheader">

</table>

<p><term><a></a></term>
The orange <term>Flash</term> piece is a single block in either the <fg>foreground</fg> or <bg>background</bg>
(with a red- or blue-tinted border, respectively).  Instead of rotating, this piece will shift
between the <fg>foreground</fg> and <bg>background</bg> when
<term><a href="controls.html#turn">turned</a></term></p>

<p>When it lands, a Flash piece will disappear instead of <term>locking</term> in place.  However,
every block directly above the Flash piece - in both the <fg>foreground</fg> and <bg>background</bg> - will
<term>unlock</term> from their neighbors and fall, filling gaps and possibly setting up row
<term>clears</term>.</p>

<p>Flash pieces should be landed as low in the field as possible, directly under a large
column of blocks.  The Flash piece's small size and its ability to shift between 
<fg>foreground</fg> and <bg>background</bg> allow it to be maneuvered into very tight spaces deep
within a stack of blocks.</p>


<a name="3d"/>

	<td class="subheader"><subheader>3D Tetrominoes</subheader></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Green 3D tetrominoes extend into both the <fg>foreground</fg> 
and the <bg>background</bg>; they stack with
both red and blue blocks.  However, a 3D block will be removed if either the <fg>foreground</fg> 
or <bg>background</bg> row <term>clears</term>.  3D tetrominoes provide a reward if they are completely
cleared immediately after landing, before the next piece can appear: either an entire
column of blocks will unlock and fall to fill gaps, or new blocks will appear and fall
into available valleys.</p>

<p>3D tetrominoes should be used only when you're sure they can fill enough rows to be
completely removed - a 3D block sitting in the field can be very difficult to maneuver around.</p>

<a name="links"/>
<table class="subheader">

	<th class="subheader"><img src="../../png/special/special_links.png" class="center" width="70%" alt="..."/></th>
	<td class="subheader"><subheader>Links</subheader></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Links appear in unconnected groups of four, shaped like a tetromino.  A Link includes 
a <fg>foreground</fg> and a <bg>background</bg> component, linked together.  Each Link will fall independently
into cracks, without <term>locking</term> to blocks to the left or right, but the <fg>foreground</fg> 
and <bg>background</bg> components of a single Link will not separate until one has been <term>cleared</term>
away.</p>

<p>Links can be useful for filling awkward gaps, but require careful consideration of both
the <fg>foreground</fg> and <bg>background</bg> to be used effectively.</p>

<a name="fused"/>
<table class="subheader">
<tr>
	<th class="subheader"><img src="../../png/special/special_fused.png" class="center" width="46%" alt="..."/></th>
	<td class="subheader"><subheader>Fused Tetracube</subheader></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The <fg>foreground</fg> and <bg>background</bg> blocks in a normal tetracube separate upon
landing; the grey-tinted block in
a Fused tetracube, on the other hand, connects the <fg>foreground</fg> and <bg>background</bg> together.
If carelessly placed, a Fused tetracube can permanently join <fg>foreground</fg> and <bg>background</bg>
blocks into a single stack.</p>

<p>Through careful positioning, a Fused block can be "activated."  An activated block changes
the way its row is <term>cleared</term> - instead of <fg>foreground</fg> and <bg>background</bg>
clearing independently,
all blocks in the row will be cleared together.  In other words, when a Fused block is
activated, the row will be cleared as if the <fg>foreground</fg> and <bg>background</bg>
have been flattened together.</p>

<p>A Fused tetracube will activate upon <term>locking</term>, provided all of its <fg>foreground</fg>
blocks have locked in front of existing <bg>background</bg> blocks (and not empty space), and its
<bg>background</bg> blocks behind existing <fg>foreground</fg> blocks.  A Fused block remains activated
until it causes a clear.</p>

<p><img src="../../png/special/monochrome_clear.png" width="60%" class="center"/></p>

<p class="caption">An activated Fused block is about to clear this row: although the <fg>foreground</fg>
and <bg>background</bg> have gaps, the row would be full if both were flattened together.</p>

<p><subsubheader>Special Versus Pieces</subsubheader></p>

<p>Certain mulitplayer game modes provide special block types apart from those
found in most game types.</p>

<a name="3d_block"/>
<table class="subheader">

	<th class="subheader"><img src="../../png/special/special_3d_block.png" class="center" width="35%" alt="..."/></th>

</table>

<p>Green 3D blocks can be used to attack your opponent in
<a href="game_modes.html#bitter_pull">Bitter Pill</a> mode.
When used, they fall into your opponent's game field, landing on
existing blocks.  Like a <a href="#3d">3D tetromino</a>, the 3D blocks
extend into both the <fg>foreground</fg> and the <bg>background</bg>,
and can be removed if either the <fg>foreground</fg> 
or <bg>background</bg> row <term>clears</term>.  Clearing a 3D block
will allow you to send it back to your opponent.</p>

<a name="push_block"/>
<table class="subheader">
<tr>
	<th class="subheader"><img src="../../png/special/special_push_down.png" class="center" width="35%" alt="..."/></th>
	<td class="subheader"><subheader>Push Blocks</subheader></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Push blocks appear in <a href="game_modes.html#gravity">Gravity</a>
mode, which otherwise uses Retro blocks.
Blue, downward-pointing push blocks will push the bottom row in your game
field into your opponent's game, while orange, upward-pointing push blocks
do the reverse.</p>

<p>Push blocks can be cleared in the normal way, but clearing one has
a unique effect.  Clearing one of your own downward-pointing push blocks
will result in a "penalty" garbage row; clearing one of your opponent's
upward-pointing push blocks will return the pushed row from your game field
back to your opponent's.</p>
