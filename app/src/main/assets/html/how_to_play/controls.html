<p>Quantro allows two different control styles: gamepad and gesture.  Select and configure
your controls in the <a href="activity://QuantroPreferences">Settings</a> menu.</p>

<p><a href="#gamepad">Gamepad</a> controls fill the touchscreen with "buttons" that can be tapped
or held to move the current piece, or activate other features.  The gamepad control
style is designed for use with both hands (touching buttons with your thumbs)
on a device with a 4&quot; or smaller screen.  A thumbnail showing button locations
is always available on the pause-screen, and on the edges of the game window.</p>

<p><a href="#gesture">Gesture</a> controls include a few touchscreen "buttons,"
but pieces are moved by dragging, swiping or tapping a finger anywhere else
on the screen surface.  The gesture control style is designed for devices with
screens 5&quot; or larger.</p>

<p>All basic piece movements are available in either control style, but some
advanced movement techniques, such as 180-turns and leans, are only available
with certain configurations.  By default all advanced movement techniques are available.</p>

<p><a name="piece"/><subheader>Piece Movement</subheader></p>

<p><term>Pieces</term> fall from the top of the screen at a speed determined by your current <term>game level</term>.
Until they <term>lock</term> into place, falling pieces can be maneuvered using <term>moves</term>, <term>turns</term> and
<term>drops</term>.  Custom game modes can optionally allow <term>flips</term>.</p>

<p><a name="move"/><term><a></a></term>
A <term>move</term> shifts the piece horizontally by one block width.  Advanced players might also use
<term><a href="advanced_techniques.html#quick_slide">quick-slides</a></term> to move the piece the
entire width of the game field.</p>

<p><img src="../../gif/move/move.gif" width="60%" class="center"/></p>
<p class="caption">Moving in both directions.</p>

<p><a name="turn"/><term><a></a></term>
A <term>turn</term> rotates the current piece by 90 degrees.  The piece
will remain in the same location as it turns.  If there isn't enough room available
for a piece to turn in-place, it will <term><a href="advanced_techniques.html#kick">kick</a></term> away from obstacles
to complete the rotation.
Advanced players can also use <term><a href="advanced_techniques.html#180_turn">180-degree turns</a></term>.</p>

<p><img src="../../gif/turn/turn.gif" width="60%" class="center"/></p>
<p class="caption">Counter-clockwise and clockwise turns.</p>

<p><a name="drop"/>A <term>drop</term> will immediately lower the current piece to its eventual
landing position.  Depending on how you've configured your controls, you may
have time to make a few final adjustments before the piece <term>locks</term>.
Dropping a piece will earn a small number of <a href="game_basics.html#score">points</a>.</p>

<p><a name="flip"/><term><a></a></term>
A <term>flip</term> turns the piece top-over-bottom.  Flips are only available
in custom game modes, where they might be used instead of or in addition to turns.

<table class="subheader">

<p>In the gamepad control style, there is an onscreen "button" for each movement.  These buttons fill the screen
from edge to edge; to avoid obscuring your view of the game, they are invisible until touched.</p>

<p>Tapping a <term>move</term> button will shift the piece horizontally by one block width.
If the button is held, the piece will <a href="advanced_techniques.html#quick_slide">quick-slide</a>
in that direction until the block is released.</p>

<p>The <term>turn</term> buttons rotate the current piece by 90 degrees.  Using both together allows
a <a href="advanced_techniques.html#180_turn">180-degree turns</a>; holding a move button and/or
the drop button while turning will cause a <a href="advanced_techniques.html#lean">lean</a> in that direction.</p>

<p>The effect of the <term>drop</term> button can be configured in the
<a href="activity://QuantroPreferences">Settings</a> menu.  By
default, holding the button will make the piece fall more quickly until it lands,
and double-tapping the button will immediately drop the piece to its eventual
landing position and lock it in place (earning points based on the distance traveled).</p>

<p>When available, tapping the <term>flip</term> button will flip the current piece vertically.</p>

<p><a name="gesture"/><subheader>Gesture Controls</subheader></p>

<p>In the gesture control style, piece movement is controlled by touchscreen drags,
swipes and taps.</p>

<p>To <term>move</term> a piece, touch the screen and drag your finger left or right.  The piece
will follow your finger until it hits an obstacle.  Swiping your finger left
or right will cause a <a href="advanced_techniques.html#quick_slide">quick-slide</a> in that direction.

<p>Tap to <term>turn</term> pieces.  Tapping the left side of the screen will cause a counter-clockwise
turn, while the right side will turn the piece clockwise.  Dragging a piece with
one finger and then tapping with a second will cause a
<a href="advanced_techniques.html#lean">lean</a> in the drag direction.</p>

<p>Pieces can be pulled down gradually by dragging a finger downward, or <term>dropped</term> to 
the bottom of the screen with a downward swipe (earning points based on the distance traveled).</p>

<p>When available, swipe upward to <term>flip</term> a piece vertically.</p>

<p><a name="other"/><subheader>Other Buttons</subheader></p>

<p>Certain actions are always controlled by an onscreen button, no matter the control style.</p>

<p><a name="reserve"/>Pieces enter the game in a random order, but in most game modes a single
piece can be held in reserve for later use.  Pressing the <term>reserve</term> button
will release the held piece, replacing the piece currently falling.</p>

<p>Different game types use reserve pieces in different ways.  In most
<a href="game_modes.html#retro">Retro</a>
games the reserve is initial empty.  Once a piece is placed in reserve, it
can be swapped with the falling piece, placing it in reserve and the held piece
in play.  In most <a href="game_modes.html#quantro">Quantro</a> games the reserve holds random
<term><a href="special_pieces.html">special pieces</a></term>
which can provide a significant advantage if used skillfully.  When used,
these pieces replace the currently falling piece, which will reappear as the next
piece to enter.</p>

<p><a name="attack"/>A few multiplayer game types, such as Bitter Pill,
replace the reserve button with an <term>attack</term> button.  Attacks are typically
earned through skilled gameplay (e.g. clearing a certain number of rows, clearing
many rows at once, etc.).  Once earned, tapping the attack button will unleash an
attack (specific to the game type) on your opponent's game.</p>

<p><a name="score"/>Your current <term>level</term> and <term>score</term> are displayed
at the edge of the screen in an abbreviated form.  Press and hold the score button to see
a more detailed description.</p>

<p><a name="opponent"/>Opposite the score is a small thumbnail of your opponent's
<term>field</term>.  Touch and hold this thumbnail to full-screen their field
(<a href="game_modes.html#versus">Versus mode</a> only).</p>
