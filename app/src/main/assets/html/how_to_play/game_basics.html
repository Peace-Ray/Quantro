<p>Quantro is a falling-block puzzle game.  The object is to keep the blocks
from stacking to the top of the screen by completely filling rows, which
are automatically cleared away.</p>

<p><term>Pieces</term> fall one at a time from the top of the screen.  Most pieces are composed
of four <term>blocks</term> - <term><a href="game_modes#retro">Retro</a></term> games use tetrominoes (made of four squares),
while <term><a href="game_modes#quantro">Quantro</a></term>
games also include tetracubes (four cubes).  Custom games can additional piece types.</p>

<p><term><a></a></term>
You can
<term><a href="controls.html#move">move</a></term>,
<term><a href="controls.html#turn">turn</a></term>, and
<term><a href="controls.html#drop">drop</a></term>
falling pieces until they
<term>lock</term> in place after landing.  Custom game modes may
also allow <term><a href="controls.html#flip">flips</a></term>.</p>

<p>If a piece completes a full row when it locks, that row will be <term>cleared</term> to make room
for more blocks.</p>

<p>The game is over when blocks stack to the top of the game <term>field</term> and there is no room
for another piece to enter.</p>

<p><a name="screen"/><subheader>Screen Layout</subheader></p>

<p><term><a></a></term>
The center of the screen shows the game <term>field</term>, where the currently falling
piece is controlled.  The left edge includes a preview of the next piece to enter
and, in Versus mode, a thumbnail of your opponent's game.  The right edge shows
the piece currently held in
<term><a href="controls.html#reserve">reserve</a></term> (or ready for <a href="controls.html#attack">attack</a>)
and an abbreviated description
of your current <term>level</term> and <term>score</term>.  Both edges provide reminders of the
location of any on-screen
<a href="controls.html">controls</a>.</p>

<p><a name="score"/><subheader>Scoring Points</subheader></p>

<p><term><a></a></term>
Points are earned primarily by clearing rows (<a href="controls.html#drop">dropping</a> a piece
will also earn a small number of points).  The more rows cleared at once or in a <term>cascade</term>
resulting from a single piece, the more points will be earned.  Additionally, more points can
be earned at higher game levels.</p>

<p>Points earned are multiplied against your current <term>multiplier</term> before being
added to your total.  Your multiplier will begin at &times;1.0 and can be increased by
certain in-game actions.  If you go long enough without clearing rows or increasing
your multiplier, it will gradually drop back to &times;1.0.</p>

<p>In Retro and Quantro games, your multiplier increases when:
	<br/>	
	<ul class="tight" type="square">
	<li>Two or more rows are cleared with a gap (a row that isn't cleared) between them.</li>
	<li>A row is cleared by an immobile piece: a piece that locked where it couldn't
			move in any direction (even up).  Use turns to lock pieces this way.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	
<p>In Quantro games, your multiplier will also increase when:
	<br/>	
	<ul class="tight" type="square">
	<li>A <a href="special_pieces.html#3d">3D piece</a> clears completely after landing.</li>
	<li>A <a href="special_pieces.html#fused">fused</a> piece locks, activates, and causes a row clear.</li>
	<li>A <a href="special_pieces.html#flash">flash</a> piece unlocks blocks, causing a row clear.</li>
	<li>At least one row in both the <fg>foreground</fg> and the <bg>background</bg> is cleared by a <a href="special_pieces.html#links">links</a> piece.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	
<p>Raising and maintaining your score multiplier is the key to high scoring games.</p>
