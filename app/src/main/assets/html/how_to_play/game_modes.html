<p>Games in Quantro come in two basic "styles:" <term>Retro</term>, which uses familiar
pieces and game ideas, and <term>Quantro</term>, which builds on the familiar formula using
new pieces and gameplay mechanics.  Both styles are available in a variety of game modes.</p>

<p><a name="retro"/><term>Retro</term> games use seven different
<term>tetrominoes</term> (shapes made of four squares) that fall in a random order, stacking
in the two-dimensional field.</p>  Custom <term>Retro</term> games can also
include trominoes (three squares) and pentominoes (five squares).

<p><term><a></a></term>When a <term><a href="controls.html#reserve">reserve</a></term> piece is used, it will swap positions with the currently
falling piece.  This lets you hold a piece in reserve until you find
the perfect opportunity to use it.</p>

<p><a name="quantro"/><term>Quantro</term> games use seven tetrominoes
combined with seven different <term>tetracubes</term> (shapes made of four cubes).
Tetrominoes and tetracubes stack in a three-dimensional field.</p>

<p>Blocks in the <fg>foreground</fg> are semi-transparent, and tinted red.  Blocks in the 
<bg>background</bg> are tinted blue.  Tetrominoes enter in either the <fg>foreground</fg>
or the <bg>background</bg>, and are colored accordingly; tetracubes include both <fg>foreground</fg>
and <bg>background</bg> blocks.</p>

<p><term><a></a></term>
The <term><a href="controls.html#reserve">reserve</a></term> holds random <a href="special_pieces.html">special pieces</a> which can provide a significant
advantage if used skillfully.  When used, these pieces replace the currently falling
piece, which will reappear as the next piece to enter.</p>

<p><fg>Foreground</fg> and <bg>background</bg> blocks stack - and clear - independently.  Certain special
pieces will interact with blocks in the <fg>foreground</fg> and <bg>background</bg> at the same time.</p>


<p><a name="modes"/><subheader>Game Modes</subheader></p>

<p>Quantro includes many different game modes: <term>Endurance</term>, <term>Progression</term>, <term>Flood</term>, <term>Versus</term>, <term>Flood Versus</term>, and
several advanced and unique versus game modes.  Most game modes can be played
using Quantro or Retro pieces.</p>

<p><a name="single_player"/><subsubheader>Single Player</subsubheader></p>

<p><a name="endurance"/>In <term>Endurance</term> mode, pieces enter from the top
one-by-one until the game ends.  After
a certain number of rows are cleared, the game will smoothly transition to the next
level without any interruption in gameplay.  At higher levels pieces fall
faster but higher scores are possible.  Endurance games can be optionally started
with <term>garbage</term> - field rows partially filled with blocks - for an added challenge.
An Endurance game ends when the field fills with blocks.  Endurance mode is for 1 player only.</p>

<p><a name="progression"/><term>Progression</term> mode allows players to take a break between levels, and even repeat the
most recent level as many times as they like before moving on.  Because pieces fall
faster at higher levels, you may want to replay a level several times until you end
in an advantageous position.  Optionally, new <term>garbage</term> rows can be added between
levels.  In a Progression game you can restart the current level if the screen fills
with blocks.  Progression mode is for 1 player only.</p>

<p><a name="flood"/><term>Flood</term> mode presents players with the constant threat of
blocks rising from below the game field.  These rows are added in real-time, requiring fast
reaction by players to stay ahead of the rising tide.    Higher levels bring faster speeds,
for both falling pieces and rising rows.  Flood games can be optionally started with garbage
rows, and the game ends when the field fills with blocks.  Flood mode is for 1 player only.</p>

<p><a name="multiplayer"/><subsubheader>Multiplayer</subsubheader></p>

<p><a name="versus"/><term>Versus</term> mode provides a head-to-head competition between players.  Like Endurance
mode there are no breaks between levels.  When you clear 2 or more rows at once,
<term>garbage</term> rows will be sent to your opponent, pushing all the blocks in their
game field up after their next piece lands.  A Versus game ends when either your or your
opponent's field fills with blocks - whichever player still has room for new pieces
is the winner.  Versus mode is for 2 players only.</p>

<p><a name=flood_versus"/><term>Flood Versus</term> mode allows competitive gameplay
with the slowly-rising blocks of Flood mode.  When you clear 2 or more rows at once,
your opponent's rising flood of blocks will temporarily accelerate.  Keep clearing
multiple rows to keep the pressure on your opponent.  A Flood Versus game ends when
either your or your opponent's field fills with blocks.  Flood Versus mode is for
2 players only.</p>

<p><a name="special_versus"/><subsubheader>Advanced Multiplayer</subsubheader></p>

<p><a name=bitter_pill"/><term>Bitter Pill</term> is an advanced multiplayer game mode
using Quantro blocks.  Unlike most Quantro game types, no
reserve is available.
Instead, the reserve button is replaced by an <a href="controls.html#attack">attack</a></term>
button, which allows you to send up to four <a href="special_pieces.html#3d_block">3D blocks</a> into
your opponent's game.  These blocks can be difficult to work around, interfering with your
opponent's strategy and giving you a competitive advantage.  Earn more 3D blocks by clearing
rows, especially rows that contain 3D blocks your opponent has sent into your own game field.
Bitter Pill is for 2 players only.</p>

<p><a name="gravity"/><term>Gravity</term> is an advanced multiplayer game mode using
Retro blocks.  Unlike most Retro game types, you cannot place game pieces in reserve; instead,
<term><a href="special_pieces.html#push_block">push blocks</a></term> are available to replace 
your current piece.  Push blocks can be earned by clearing enough block rows, and up to four
can be held in reserve at once.  Use push blocks to send rows from your screen to your opponent's,
but be careful setting up row clears &mdash; clear away your own push blocks and you'll receive
a penalty row.  Gravity is for 2 players only.</p>
