<p>Most of these techniques require skilled use Quantro's controls, and may not
be possible for players using hardware buttons, single-touch touchscreens, or
certain control configurations.</p>

A <term>quick-slide</term> will immediately move the current piece as far to the left
(or right) as possible.  In the <a href="controls.html#gesture">gesture</a> control
style, swiping horizontally will cause a single quick-slide.  For
<a href="controls.html#gamepad">gamepad</a> controls, press and hold a 
<term><a href="controls.html#move">move button</a></term> to start a quick-slide.
As long as the button is
held, the piece will continue to slide in that direction, such as when a <term>turn</term>,
<term>drop</term> or <term>fall</term> moves it away from an obstacle.</p>

<p>Quick-slides are especially helpful on higher levels when fast piece movement is a requirement.</p>

<p><term><a></a></term>
Pieces normally rotate by 90 degrees when <term><a href="controls.html#turn">turned</a></term>.
Using both the clockwise and counter-clockwise turn buttons together produces
a 180-degree turn.
First press and hold one of the buttons (say, clockwise), then tap the second (CCW).
The piece will first rotate 90 degrees clockwise &mdash; if possible &mdash; then 180 degrees counter-clockwise.  As
long as the first button is held, the second will produce a 180-degree rotation each time
it is tapped.  180-turns are always available in the <a href="controls.html#gamepad">gamepad</a>
control style, and can be used in the <a href="controls.html#gesture">gesture</a> control
style if on-screen turn buttons have been activated in the <a href="activity://QuantroPreferences">Settings</a>
menu.</p>

<p>180-turns are useful when normal turns are impossible, or to fit a piece where
normal turns can't.</p>

<p><a name="kick"/><subheader>Kicks</subheader></p>

<p>When a falling piece is positioned next to a wall or other blocks and <term>turned</term>,
it will sometimes need to move to a new position to avoid the obstacle.  This move is
called a <term>kick</term>.  Kicks can be used to maneuver around blocks and get pieces into
tricky positions.</p>

<p class="caption">A kick helps get this piece into position.</p>

<p><a name="lean"/><subheader>Leans</subheader></p>

<p>When a piece <term>kicks</term> away from an obstacle it will tend to move in the direction
it was <term>turned</term> &mdash; right for clockwise, left for counter-clockwise.</p>

<p><term><a></a></term>
You can override this preference by moving the piece in the preferred piece direction just
before a turn.  This is called a <term>lean</term>.  In the <a href="controls.html#gamepad">gamepad</a>
control style, lean by pressing and holding one or more of the <term>move</term> and <term>drop</term> buttons
before tapping the <term>turn</term> button.  For <a href="controls.html#gesture">gesture</a>
controls, use one finger to drag the piece in the preferred lean direction and then tap the screen
with a second finger before releasing the first.</p>

<p>As an example, if you turn  a piece clockwise while "leaning down and left" (holding
the <term><a href="controls.html#drop">drop button</a></term> and move left
button, or dragging down and left with another finger), the piece will prefer to kick downwards and to the left,
rather than to the right.</p>

<p>Note: control configurations that lock the piece automatically when dropped will prevent
downward leans.</p>

<p class="caption">Depending on the lean direction, this piece could
kick in several different ways.</p>
