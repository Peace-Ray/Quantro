	<p><subsubheader>Dogac's Demo APK</subsubheader></p>
	
	<p>Hi Dogac.  This demo APK should give you an idea of the new features
	and game modes coming in an update.</p>
	
	<p>In particular, try the "flood" game modes and the new unique "VS" game types
	(you'll need a second device to play them).  There are placeholder sounds used
	for the events described in the commission file.</p>
	
	<p>One of the changes in this update is to move from "Quantro XL" that removes
	ads, to a collection of premium items for sale, each of which unlocks
	a specific (new) feature.  Getting any of them will remove ads as well.</p>
	
	<p>Your old XL key will unlock all the new game modes.  You can enter it
	by tapping the "padlock" on the main menu, then the "key" on the screen that
	appears.</p>

	<p>Have fun!</p>
