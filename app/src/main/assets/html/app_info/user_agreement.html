<p>This document describes the agreement between Peace Ray LLC and users of Quantro&trade;.
Specific information regarding Peace Ray's privacy policy can be found
<a href="privacy_policy.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>This software is provided 'as-is,' without any express or implied waranty.  Peace Ray LLC
and the creators of this app will not be held liable for any damages arising from
the use of this software.</p>

<p>Although Peace Ray has made every effort to ensure that the contents of this
document accurately reflect the behavior of this app ("Quantro") and the policies applied
by Peace Ray, mistakes do occur.  Peace Ray LLC and the creators of this app
will not be held liable for any inconsistencies.</p>

<p>Peace Ray reserves the right to clarify or alter this user agreement at any time.</p>

<p><subheader>Active Development</subheader></p>

<p>Quantro is no longer in active development and bugs may be present when run on current or future Android OS devices.
Problems or connection failures may occur during multiplayer sessions. Internet multiplayer requires
communication with an external server, which may experience indefinite downtime; the availability
of this feature is not guaranteed.</p>

<p><subheader>Supported Devices</subheader></p>

<p>Quantro is available on devices running Android&trade; 4.4 and is optimized for high-end devices.
Performance may suffer and certain features may not be available on lower-end hardware, or devices
using earlier versions of Android.  These features include high-framerate rendering and multiplayer gameplay.</p>

<p><subheader>Appropriate Usage</subheader></p>

<p>Quantro includes features that communicate with other devices and with
remote servers.  App users should not attempt
to disrupt, intercept or otherwise interfere with these communications,
whether they originate from the user's device, other devices, or a remote server.
</p>

<p>Users of WiFi or Internet multiplayer should show respect for other players
at all times.  This includes playing fairly (e.g. not using exploits or cheats)
and avoiding the use of insulting, derogatory or explicit terms in lobby names,
chats, or other text.  Peace Ray makes no guarantee that users will not encounter
these actions on the part of other players.
</p>

<p><subheader>Unlocking Features and Content</subheader></p>

<p>Quantro previously featured premium content which was locked until purchased in-app. This
release features all previously premium content for free, for everyone.</p>

<p><subheader>Internet Multiplayer</subheader></p>

<p>Internet multiplayer is an experimental feature.
Its availability and the quality of service is not guaranteed in either
the short- or the long-term.  Internet multiplayer service may be suspended
at any time for any reason, and for any number of users.
</p>

<p><subheader>Privacy and Messaging</subheader></p>

<p>Internet multiplayer is not currently in active development, but hypothetical future versions
may require limited access to your personal information.  This access would be entirely at your
discretion and no personal information will be collected without your permission.</p>

<p>More detailed information is available in Quantro's <a href="../privacy_policy.html">privacy policy</a>.
