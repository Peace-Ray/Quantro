<p>This document describes Peace Ray LLC's policy regarding the private data of Quantro&trade;
users.  The complete user agreement can be found <a href="user_agreement.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Within this document, "Peace Ray" refers to Peace Ray LLC and representatives thereof,
"Quantro" refers to the Android&trade; app with package name com.peaceray.quantro running on an
end-user's device, "Quantro servers" refers to the multiplayer and activation servers

<p><subheader>General Information</subheader></p>

<p>Internet multiplayer is an experimental feature. Availability is not guaranteed and there may be
periods of inaccessibility.</p>

<p>Previous versions of Quantro's Internet multiplayer was limited to registered beta-testers and
required access to specific user information.  This information was and will not be
distributed or shared with anyone outside of Peace Ray.</p>

<p>If and when future updates to Internet multiplayer make access to user data necessary,
this privacy policy will be updated to reflect the specifics.  You will always be asked
for permission before any personal data is collected.  Peace Ray respects your privacy.</p>

<p><subheader>Analytics</subheader></p>

<p>Quantro previously collected anonymous usage data and transmitted this data to the Flurry
Analytics servers. This version does not transmit any such analytics data. Future versions may
re-enable analytic data collection; you can prevent this by disabling the feature in the
<a href="activity://QuantroPreferences">Settings</a> menu.  Data previously collected was only used to improve
Quantro.</p>
