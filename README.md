## Description

Quantro is a falling tetromino puzzle game for Android. Originally released
in 2012, it is now available under an open-source software license.
Enjoy classic gameplay in "Retro" mode; tetracubes and
3D-pieces provide a unique play experience in "Quantro" mode.  All game
modes are available in single-player and WiFi / Internet multiplayer
(Internet multiplayer is experimental and not actively supported; availability
is not guaranteed).

This version is completely free and includes all premium features from previous
releases.

### Permissions

* Access Wifi State / Network State: for multiplayer.

## Author Note

I worked on Quantro from 2011 to 2013 to teach myself game design and
Android app development; it was released on Google Play in 2012 but was removed
in 2014, after I had moved to other projects and ceased active development and
support.

In 2021 I returned to the code base, updating Quantro to run on modern
Android OS versions and cleaning the project up a little for open source
release. Other than these changes it's basically the same code I wrote ten
years ago and should be viewed as an artifact from an inexperienced developer
learning the ropes.

I don't plan to actively continue development of Quantro, although I may review
and clean up the multiplayer server code for open source release eventually.

Thanks, and have fun!
