## Installation

Quantro may be built from source (this project uses Android Studio) or installed
directly as an APK (see [Quantro Releases](https://github.com/Peace-Ray/Quantro/releases)).

Although Quantro is unlikely to return to the Google Play Store, support for other
app repositories is pending.

## Description

Quantro is a falling tetromino puzzle game for Android. Originally released
in 2012, it is now available under an open-source software license.
Enjoy classic gameplay in "Retro" mode; tetracubes and
3D-pieces provide a unique play experience in "Quantro" mode.  All game
modes are available in single-player and WiFi / Internet multiplayer
(Internet multiplayer is experimental and not actively supported; availability
is not guaranteed).

This version is completely free and includes all premium features from previous
releases.

### Permissions

* Internet: so you can play online.
* Access Wifi State / Network State: for multiplayer.
* Wake Lock: so you don't get disconnected from a multiplayer game or lobby.
* Android Beam (NFC): to invite players directly into a multiplayer lobby

## Author Note

I worked on Quantro from 2011 to 2013 to teach myself game design and
Android app development; it was released on Google Play in 2012 but was removed
in 2014, after I had moved to other projects and ceased active development and
support.

In 2021 I returned to the code base, updating Quantro to run on modern
Android OS versions and cleaning the project up a little for open source
release. Other than these changes it's basically the same code I wrote ten
years ago. In other words, it does not follow modern Android development conventions,
nor match the code style and design patterns I'd use today. Updating the project
to compile and run on modern Android systems has also introduced bugs and bottlenecks
that may not have occurred in the original release. In short, this project
should be viewed as an artifact from an inexperienced developer learning the
ropes -- not a representative example of modern Android app development.

I don't plan to actively continue development of Quantro, although I may review
and clean up the multiplayer server code for open source release eventually.

Thanks, and have fun!
