  Images derived from this icon set are used to label Quantro gameplay buttons.
  They are modified from their original form. Each is rasterized in both white
  and black; Quantro displays those two versions layered over each other to
  produce a drop-shadow effect. The following images, located in
  app/src/main/res/ and subdirectories, are derived from this icon set (all
  files with these prefixes):

    arrow_left
    arrow_right
    arrow_up_down
    bolt
    curved_arrow
    curved_arrow_ccw

  Images derived from the Android system icons are used to label Quantro menu
  and navigation buttons. In some cases they were modified according to Android
  Icon Design guidelines for menu icons; in others, drop shadows were added to
  better fit Quantro's app UI for navigation and menus. The following images,
  located in app/src/main/res and subdirectories, are derived from Android
  system icons (all files with these prefixes):
